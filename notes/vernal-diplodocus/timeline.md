# Timeline of the casts leading to the rearing _Barosaurus_

* 1901–1905 (more precision would be good): Carnegie Museum makes molds of _Diplodocus_
* 1905: Casts from these molds are erected as the mount at the BMNH, the second mounted sauropod in the world after the AMNH _Brontosaurus_.
* 1905–: Nine more casts are sent to  Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Madrid, St Petersburg, Bologna, La Plata, Mexico City and Munich.
* 1907: The actual fossils (and some sculpted elements) are mounted at the Carnegie Museum.
* 1914: The Great War breaks out, ending Carnegie's arbitration campaign that was the main reason for donating casts, and reducing the pace of creating new casts.
* 1917 or earlier: the molds went into storage and are not used again, according to Untermann (1959:364). However:
* 1931/1932: casts made of the _Diplodocus_ for Munich and Mexico City (Niuewland, pers. comm., 2022)
* 1948, autumn: The Utah Field House is built and opened.
* "Some time later", likely in the mid-1950s: J. LeRoy Kay, Carnegie's curator of vertebrate paleontology, gifts the original molds to the Field House
* 1957: The Utah Field House's concrete cast is mounted outdoors (Gangewere 1999:17)
* 1960s: the original casts are thrown away.
* 1988, January: plans are made to have a lightweight indoor replica of the concrete cast created by the Las Vegas Museum, but these plans fall through.
* 1989, April: Jim Madsen of Dinolab is contacted to make new plans for creating a replica
* 1989, June 30 onwards: Dinolab repaired the deteriorated concrete cast, stabilizing, restoring and sealing the bones. Jim Madsen of Dinolab made new molds from the repaired concrete _Diplodocus_, using them to create a new lightweight indoor _Diplodocus_ cast for the Field House, from WEP (water-expanded polyester), and reserving the right to make up to 20 additional casts (Madsen et al. 1989)
* 1991, not later than June 30: Dinolab is contracted to deliver the indoor mount (Madsen et al. 1989) — but I don't know when it actually arrived and was mounted.
* Some time subsequent to 1989: Jack McIntosh arranges a deal between Dinolab and RCI whereby the Dinolab creates casts of the _Diplodocus_ elements needed to make up the missing part of the AMNH _Barosaurus_ mount.
* Subsequent years: further casts are made from the Dinolab molds, including one for the Houston Natural History Museum.
* 2013: The original concrete cast is sent to Utah State University Eastern Prehistoric Museum on effectively permanent loan, and to be repaired. It was intended to be mounted outdoors on the campus, but this does not seem to have happened.
* 2019: Dinolab storage in Ogden, Utah, is scheduled for demolition. The _Diplodocus_ molds that were taken from the concrete cast are moved to RCI, where they are kept in storage: some in good condition, some in rough shape. These are probably the only Carnegie _Diplodocus_ molds in the world.

According to Gangewere 1999:17, the creation of the concrete _Diplodocus_ was the last time the original Carnegie molds (described  "deteriorating") had been used, at least until that point, so the invitation offered by Untermann (1959:369), "Does anyone wish to cast the twelfth?" seems to have gone unanswered.

Does anyone know where the molds are now? Steve, you wrote "DINOLABS had all the molds. Apparently Carnegie didn't have the old molds, so I believe DINOLABS made new ones to create new replicas." So I think you're saying that DinolabS had new molds taken from the concrete _Diplodocus_ (right?) — but then what happened to the original Carnegie molds? Does Dinolab even exist any more?

Finally: I am struggling to make out the signatures on the Madsen et al. agreement. Can anyone help with the names?
