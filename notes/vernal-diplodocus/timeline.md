# Timeline of the casts leading to the rearing _Barosaurus_

* 1901–1904 (more precision would be good): Carnegie Museum makes molds of _Diplodocus_
* 1904: Five casts are made from these molds
* 1905, May 12: The first cast from these molds is erected as the mount at the BMNH, the second mounted sauropod in the world after the AMNH _Brontosaurus_.
* 1907, April: The actual fossils (and some sculpted elements) are mounted at the Carnegie Museum.
* 1908: further casts are erected in Berlin and Paris
* 1909: the last two casts of the original batch are mounted in Vienna and Bologna.
* 1909-1910: five further casts are made from the molds
* 1910: a cast is mouned in St. Petersburgh (now Leningrad)
* 1912: another cast is mounted in La Plata
* 1913: another cast is mounted in Madrid
* 1914: The Great War breaks out, ending Carnegie's arbitration campaign that was the main reason for donating casts, and reducing the pace of creating new casts.
* 1917 or earlier: the molds went into storage and are not used again, according to Untermann (1959:364).
* 1932: the penultimate cast is mount in Mexico (with missing/damaged parts produced and added in 1931/2)
* 1934: the final cast is sent to Munich, but never mounted.
* 1948, autumn: The Utah Field House is built and opened.
* "Some time later", likely in the mid-1950s: J. LeRoy Kay, Carnegie's curator of vertebrate paleontology, gifts the original molds to the Field House. When they arrived they were "in pretty bad shape" (Ken Carpenter, pers. comm. 2022) and "deteriorating" (Gangewere 1999:17).
* 1957: The Utah Field House's concrete cast is created, and mounted outdoors (Gangewere 1999:17). This is the last time the original molds are used.
* 1960s: the original molds are thrown away by CMNH. So the invitation that concludes Untermann (1959:369), "Does anyone wish to cast the twelfth?" seems to have gone unanswered.
* 1988, January: plans are made to have a lightweight indoor replica of the Field House concrete cast created by the Las Vegas Museum, but these plans fall through.
* 1989, April: Jim Madsen of Dinolab is contacted to make new plans for creating a replica from the concrete cast
* 1989, June 30 onwards: Dinolab repaired the deteriorated concrete cast, stabilizing, restoring and sealing the bones. Jim Madsen of Dinolab made new molds from the repaired concrete _Diplodocus_, using them to create a new lightweight indoor _Diplodocus_ cast for the Field House, from WEP (water-expanded polyester), and reserving the right to make up to 20 additional casts (Madsen et al. 1989)
* 1991, not later than June 30: Dinolab is contracted to deliver the indoor mount (Madsen et al. 1989) — but I don't know when it actually arrived and was mounted.
* 1991?: When the concrete specimen was returned, it was in bad shape and went into storage.
* XXX Some time subsequent to 1989: Jack McIntosh arranges a deal between Dinolab and RCI whereby the Dinolab creates casts of the _Diplodocus_ elements needed to make up the missing part of the AMNH _Barosaurus_ mount.
* Subsequent years: further casts are made from the Dinolab molds, including one in the Las Vegas Natural History Museum and one in the Houston Natural History Museum.
* 2013: The original concrete cast is sent to Utah State University Eastern Prehistoric Museum on effectively permanent loan, and to be repaired. It was intended to be mounted outside a new museum in Price, but this museum was never built and the cast remains in storage.
* 2019: Dinolab storage in Ogden, Utah, is scheduled for demolition. The _Diplodocus_ molds that were taken from the concrete cast are moved to RCI, where they are kept in storage: some in good condition, some in rough shape. These are probably the only Carnegie _Diplodocus_ molds in the world.
