# Material of AMNH 6341, based on McIntosh (2005)

McIntosh (2005:43) lists the material of AMNH 6341 as:

* cervicals 10-16 (?)
* dorsals 1-9
* sacrals 1-5
* caudals 1-29
* six ribs and fragments
* 1 chevron
* complete pelvis
* left scapula-coracoid and part of right scapula
* left humerus
* right hindlimb and part of pes

But the description in the rest of the paper does not consistently match this. The following additional notes expand on, and in some cases correct, the earlier material list:

* p45: cervicals 8-16
* p57: none of the dorsal ribs was complete. One of those preserved is either rib 1 or 2, implicitly from the left side. The same rib is probably also preserved on the right side.
* p58: the one preserved chevron is further back than Ca13 and was collected from near caudals 22-28.
* p59: scapula and coracoid are from right side (and firmly co-ossified)
* p60 (caption to figure 2.8:A-B): the preserved humerus is the right one
* p63: "The right ilium is complete except for a small part of the upper border; of the ieft ilium, only the acetabular portion was preserved. Both pubes and ischia were complete except for portions of the proximal ends of the pubes and the right ischium."
* p66: "The hindlimb of AMNH 6341 is beautifully preserved and uncrushed (Fig. 2.12)". It consists of right femur, tibia, fibula and astragalus.
* p70: the "partial pes" consists of MT I, II and V and phalanges I-I and V-I (table 2.13); and these bones are from the right pes (caption to figure 2.13).
