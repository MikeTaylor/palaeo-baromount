		10 October 1992. Considered C&A's proposal "highly
		speculative" and unlikely. Blood column in Barosaurus
		was only 8 m, not 12 m. Suggested amphibious habits as
		a better explanation. Proposed an "aortic bulb".

		[continued] No valves in the giraffe jugular vein, but
		"specialised seried valves prevented reflux into
		tributaries running from below into large veins", also
		seen in the Bactrian camel.

		14 November 1992. Had independently reached the
		conclusion of mutiple hearts. Calculates that a single
		heart generating 740 mm Hg would mass 7.3
		tonnes. Considers multiple hearts credible in
		Barosaurus as in hagfish. Notes impossibility of
		breathing below water. Introduces and dismisses
		possibility of siphon.

		Notes that sauropods were terrestrial and had
		lightened necks. Dismisses breathing below water.

		Points out that circulation is a closed system and
		claims siphon-like effect balancing mass of blood in
		veins and arteries. "The heart [...] has only to
		provide sufficient perfusion pressure to overcome the
		total resistance of the vascular circuit and supply
		enough blood to meet the metabolic needs of the
		tissues."
