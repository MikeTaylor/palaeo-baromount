Call for help! Can anyone who lives in #NewYork please pop into the #AMNH and get photos of the signage that accompanies the mounted #Barosaurus/#Allosaurus tableau in the Roosevelt Rotunda? many thanks!

(Yes, I am an idiot for not having captured this myself when I was there!)

Oh that's excellent -- many thanks! Is it OK to use these in a paper (if my co-authors concur)? How should I acknowledge you?

--
Amelia Zietlow
Sure! Acknowledgement in the figure caption & if the photos are shared on spcial media anywhere would be fine! Are these okay or do you want me to try to get the whole sign in one shot?

Thank you. I think these should be fine: most likely we'll just quote the text anyway.

Is there an institution we can give for you? e.g. "We that Amelia Zietlow (University of Basingstoke, UK) for photographs of the AMNH Barosaurus signage"?
