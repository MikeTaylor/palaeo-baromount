	Fantastic article on DIPLODOCUS. Loved this dinosaur as a
	child and stil today. I was fortunate to have led a crew of
	exhibit construction team featuring two skeletons, one mounted
	standing on its hind legs, for the Museum of Science and
	industry in Tampa Florida. We purchase the cast from the late
	Dr. Jim Madsen of Salt Lake City. The skeletons were mounted
	with armatures by RCI from Ontario Canada. The one cast
	mounted standing upright was the second sauropod skeletn mount
	in that stance. We based the mounting on the Barosauers
	skeleton in the AMNH in New York. During construction I had
	difficulty fitting both specimens in our lobby space. I used
	measurements of the believed lengths based on several
	scientific papers. All text at that time gave us an estimated
	length of 85 feet. I asked Jim to lay the skull and axial
	skeleton out at his lab and measure it. We came up with 75
	feet long. Once we establish the exact length I could fit
	these cast accurately in the space required. These cast still
	are providing new information and knowledge. Those
	disappointed that Dippy is a little shorter should not fret as
	now research is finding that this individual was most likely a
	juvenile and not full grown.
