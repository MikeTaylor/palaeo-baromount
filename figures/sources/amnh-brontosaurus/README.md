Subject: 1939 Baro photos

Mike, Carl Mehling found two of these and I had two already. All are AMNH copyright and in the digitized colection from what I gather. The barosaur stuff is in the wall cases but maybe there are some Diplodocus or even something else. I remember that Colbert left a pelvis and femur and some verts of a thing labeled as Diplodocus in his renovation of the hall. Perhaps some of this stuff is also in the photos. Only Jack knew.

Carl is also trying to find the resting place of my baro notes as well as Norell's but even if found may not amount to much.  Lowell and I have already replied to your reply to our reply and will send it to you for your reply. pant pant. Im not used to doing work these days. Hope you see something interesting here.   Gene
