Hi,

Here we see the danger of me doing things off the top of my head - I got it somewhat wrong regarding the 1931/2 casts. [In my book] the bit about post-Carnegie casts is on page 250 and on.

In short:
First five casts, made in early 1904: Placed in London (1905), Berlin (1908), Paris (1908), Vienna (1909), Bologna (1909), original in Pittsburgh in 1907
Another five made in late 1909/early 1910: Placed in St. Petersburgh (1910), La Plata (1912), Madrid (1913), Mexico (1932, with missing/damaged parts produced and added in 1931/2) and Munich (1934, same as Mexico, never mounted).

So Undermann may well have been right.

Best,
Ilja


"Coggeshall’s and Agostini’s molds had become almost unusable, but they generated one final complete copy. In 1954 the Carnegie Museum sent them to the Utah Field House in Vernal, where a last cast was prepared, this time in concrete. Painted red and in the open air, behind a fence, Diplodocus carnegii was accessible to any passerby for over three decades." (Nieuwland 2019:251-252).
