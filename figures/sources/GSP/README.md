Subject: Allosaurus attacking rearing Diplodocus

Hi, Greg,

I hope all is well with you, and that you're enjoying the Tyrannosaurus controversy. (I have no dog in that fight, being so focussed on sauropods myself, but it's good to see the possibility of multiple species at least get an airing.)

I'm working with Lowell Dingus and Gene Gaffney on an account of the AMNH's rearing Barosaurus mount, in the spirit of what Janensch (1950b) did for the original Giraffatitan mount in Berlin. Of course, this should really have been done 30 years ago when everything was fresh in the minds of the people involved, but I'm doing what I can to gather relevant surviving documentation.

It turns out that your painting of a herd of sauropods being attacked by theropods inspired Gaffney to suggest a Barosaurus group arrangement in which multiple Barosaur skeletons reacted to an attack by multiple Allosaurus skeletons. That original concept proved too ambitious but it's what got scaled back to give us the exhibit we have today. The picture in question is used as figure 16 on page 30 of your chapter The science and art of restoring the life appearance of dinosaurs and their relatives in Dinosaurs Past and Present, Volume 2. I'm attaching a photo.

The reason I'm writing is that we would love to include a reproduction of the painting in our article, due to its influence on the mount. You will be completely unsurprised to hear that this project is 100% unfunded, so we have no way to pay licensing fees. I'm hoping you'll feel that 30 years on you might want the painting to take its place in the story nevertheless. But I completely understand that you're a professional artist, and if you feel that you'd rather not allow uncompensated use of your work then I fully understand.

Thanks,

-- Mike.

The below info is way cool. At first I was thinking I did not remember that Ambush at Como Creek inspired the AMNH mounts. It is not like when seeing pics or being at the museum I think such. But upon thinking about it maybe I did know something about it but had forgotten. I do not think I was told at the time, if that is incorrect would like to know. Is good to know my art was responsible for the way cool display. 

You probably know this but rearing sauropods was not my idea. I think the first time the concept was shown is in a early Knight work before he became so bioconservative when it came to dinoart, was not aware of that probably until the Czarkas book on him came out. Maybe after that Riggs was the first to discuss the possibility in the academic literature. Then it was entirely forgotten as far as I know until I was shocked to see Bakker's little rearing sauropod skeletals in the 1972 encyclopedia yearbook which I probably did not see until shortly before or after meeting Dr Bob in 77, I was gob smacked. 

I learned painting late 70s at Northern Virginia Community College from a classic oils artist John Bannon. Without a commission after doing I think two medium sized works (Chasmosaurus herd later converted to Pentaceratops, running Daspletosaurus) I wanted to do a really big piece for experience and because I wanted to. A JHU crew I was part of had worked at lovely Como Bluff north that summer. When a kid at Four Mile Run park in Arlington VA I had seen a cool scence of the broad shallow creek running under over arching trees from a low bridge at the center of the stream. It was known sauropods moved in big groups from the Texa trackways, so I did the painting. The idea is that the predator/s took advantage of the cover along the watercourse to surprise the herbivores. 

At first, as the one attachment of an old old slide shows, I put in just one Allosaurus taking a shot at a juvenile that the adult is protecting, do not think that version was published but I could be wrong -- this happens to better match the AMNH display. As I recall I thought maybe that was not the best idea so I made it into a seemingly more logical attack pack, that version was probably first published in the DD&P volume. Since then the Czerkas dorsal serrations have been added to a reproduction (not the original which I do not have). 

The one probable anatomical inaccuracy is the Dippy with the head straight relative to the neck. That some of the sauropod necks are U and others S curved is OK whatever Stevens might say. I have since become skeptical that big theropods hunted in packs as I mention in my field guide and maybe earlier, I might be wrong though. The sauropod herd is basically OK, but those were not parent-offspring social groups for reasons I have discussed in the guide and maybe elsewhere -- small juveniles could not accompany the adults until they got to about a tonne, and they probably joined up with random adults who had abandoned the eggs for passive defense. So the rearing adult is now just happening to oppose the approaching pack at the same time the youngster is dashing away from the theropods, it is not mom defending her precious baby. 

The painting may now be in a landfill or incinerated. In the late 70s or so an investor dinobuff bought the piece and some others. It was so big I was glad to unload it, and in those pre JP times it went for what at the time was a reasonable $2000. After JP he wanted to buy more paintings but when I told him the higher prices he with irritation declined -- jeez they guy was in finances did he not know about the free market? A few years ago I think it was him sent an email saying he was retiring to a smaller place and did I want to buy the art back like any artist ever does that, and if not he would leave the pieces in the house for the new residents to do what they want with. That is what happened. I did not ask what particular pieces they were but I think they included ACC, it is quite possible they went into the trash. Modern paleoart is a commodity without much legacy or monetary value. 

Look forward to seeing the article.

I got out the slides and scanned them. Images copyright Gregory S. Paul 2022. 

Ah the old days, 

Cheers, 

Greg

Hi, Greg, thanks for the detailed reply, and especially for the images. Just to be 100% clear — I will probably need to justify this to an editor — are you giving us permission to use these royalty-free in the forthcoming Barosaurus-mount paper? (We will of course acknowledge you and note your copyright.)

I know that rearing sauropods go way back. The earliest reference I've found is from Osborn (1899:213), who wrote that the tail of Diplodocus “functioned as a lever to balance the weight of the dorsals, anterior limbs, neck, and head, and to raise the entire forward portion of the body upwards. […] Thus the quadrupedal Dinosaurs occasionally assumed the position characteristic of the bipedal Dinosaurs — namely, a tripodal position, the body supported upon the hind feet and the tail”. I reproduced Knight's rearing Diplodocus in my paper on the history of sauropod research in that Geol Soc edited volume (http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/dino/pubs/taylor2010/Taylor2010-sauropod-history.pdf) alongside his better-known swamp-dwelling Brontosaurus. I hadn't registered that Riggs had discussed this too, though — presume in the 1903 Apatosaurus monograph. I'll check it out when I have a moment.

Your background to this painting is fascinating. Would it be OK to quote from it in the paper? I had never heard of the encyclopedia yearbook -- is it this one? https://archive.org/details/encyclopediayear0000unse_a5j6
I had wondered whether you'd been inspired by Bakker's drawings, but the one I had in mind was http://www.miketaylor.org.uk/tmp/Bakker-fighting-brontosaurs.jpeg (which I love BTW).

Was Ambush at Como Creek seriously your third painting?!

The original version was published, by the way: I tracked it down (in monochrome only) on page 59 of Bird's 1985 book Bones for Barnum Brown: https://archive.org/details/bonesforbarnumbr00rola

Heads that are straight relative to the necks really bother me in saurpods! That said, the one in your painting is doing it in the context of a whole herd with a more normal head posture, and it doesn't seem unreasonable that in an extreme situation an animal would adopt an unusual pose. So I think you got away with it :-)

-- Mike.
