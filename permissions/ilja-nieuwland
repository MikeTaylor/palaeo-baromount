I didn't find any documentation confirming this, though, so they might just as well have stayed in Vernal. It seems like they were pretty much beyond use or repair at this point.

I’m including a link to the PDF of my book (don’t tell the publisher), which should give a clearer image. The bit about post-Carnegie casts is on page 250 and on. Here’s the link: https://www.dropbox.com/s/s0j236w5bzveznn/Nieuwland%2C%20I.%20%282019%29.%20American%20Dinosaur%20Abroad.%20A%20Cultural%20History%20of%20Carnegie%27s.pdf?dl=0
