@mike @extinctmonsters definitely looking forward to that. And wondering if it will have some space for that mount's many imitators and near-imitators.

Mike Taylor @mike@sauropods.win
@llewelly At present I don't mention imitators at all (although see the Tampa section in the Concrete preprint). I would be happy to receive pointers to other rearing sauropod mounts, though!

@mike @llewelly there's a rearing Camarasaurus at the WDC.

Mike Taylor @mike@sauropods.win
@ScottHartman @llewelly Oh, interesting! I wonder if you could furnish a good photo? https://www.google.com/search?q=rearing+Camarasaurus+WDC&sxsrf=ALiCzsYYHT19w40N-pLrbSm7tgjP0pZaEQ:1667745452312&source=lnms&tbm=isch&sa=X&ved=2ahUKEwin5Ir645n7AhWTilwKHQOAA8wQ_AUoAXoECAIQAw&biw=913&bih=718&dpr=2 comes up empty.

@llewelly @mike Dunno about mounts outside the US, but the NMNH Camarasaurus has the distinction of rearing and being real fossil material

@mike you are counting casts? The Museo Egidio Feruglio in Patagonia has a rearing _Epachtosaurus_ cast

@mike This literally just popped up on my feed. It's a Diplodocus mount in Dubai. Does this count?

@mike I knew I was forgetting one: Children’s Museum of Indianapolis, unidentified diplococid. Exhibit just opened this spring.

@mike does the replica Jurassic Park Visitor's Center at Universal Studios Orlando count? I'm not sure if it survived the Jurassic World rebranding or not.
