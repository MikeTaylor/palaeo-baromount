You’re in luck, Mike. A lot has changed here since your request and just now it was an easy yes!

Here is what the catalog card says with regard to preserved elements:

Almost complete skeleton: Caudal verts. exch. From Carnegie Mus., 1930. Skeleton (all but neck and tail) exch. From Univ. of Utah, 1930. Cervical verts. Exch. From National Mus.?

Not so sure that was as clear as you were hoping for. In our database, there is also a note (but I suspect you know about this already):

Esplin, 2017, lists the elements as: cervical, dorsal, and caudal vertebrae, chevrons, both shoulder girdles, ribs, partial right forelimb, pelvis and sacrum, right hindlimb and both pes

The 1970s photos are also included here – let me know if you receive 30 images.

Best,
Carl
