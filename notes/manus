Peter: For the front feet we took molds from the metacarpals at Dinosaur National Monument.

Mike: Only the metacarpals? What about the carpals, phalanges and unguals? Did you keep the Carnegie casts of those elements? (They were filled in from AMNH 965, which is now known to be Camarasaurus. At some point they were replaced in the Carnegie's own mount by casts of CM 662, which is now HMNS 175 and recognised as the holotype of Galeamopus hayi; but that change will not have been reflected in the molds that were used to cast the Vernal concrete Diplodocus, so the change is not directly relevant to our present project.)
