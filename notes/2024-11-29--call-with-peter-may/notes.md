# Call with Peter May, 29 November 2024

I checked with Peter that it was OK to record the meeting, and he agreed. I have copies of
[the video](video1977956780.mp4)
and
[the audio](audio1977956780.m4a).


## 1. Metacarpals

> "metacarpals from Dinosaur National Monument were used in place of the camarasaurid metacarpals." Were the metacarpals casts or the original fossils? What was the specimen number?

RCI took molds from the metacarpals of one manus (but can't remember whether it was the left or right), then cast one set of metacarpals from these and sculpted the corresponding set (as this predated the use of scanning and 3D printing, which would allow a perfect reflection). The cast and sculpture were used in the mount, and the original bones returned to DNM.

TODO: Peter will check what the specimen number of these metacarpals was.

## 2. Mirroring

> "Some missing bones, including the left scapula and tibia, were sculpted based on their right-sided counterparts." Which others, and which just used from the Carnegie _Diplodocus_? Can we know?

Peter was the only sculptor at RCI at this time, and does not sculpting anything except the metacarpals mentioned above. So we thnk the quote from the current manuscript is incorrect, and all the missing bones were filled in with corresponding bones from the Carnegie _Diplodocus_ (supplied by Dinolab, inc., created from the molds they had taken from the Concrete _Diplodocus_ of Vernal).

Jack McIntosh had inventoried the AMNH 6341 _Barosaurus_ material and ordered missing bones as casts from Dinolab, but we have not been able to find anything about this order in McIntosh's notes.

<!-- TODO: Mike will write to Lisa Madsen -->

At some point in the process, Peter went down to Dinosaur National Monument and took molds from the face of the wall. Peter can't remember what he took molds of, but they might have been juvenile elements to use as references in sculpting the baby _Barosaurus_ for the display. Dan Chure was there and may remember more. Ken Carpenter is likely to know whether there is, or was, juvenile diplodocid material exposed on the wall. (When I visited in 2016, I don't remember seeing anything that didn't look adult.)

TODO: Mike will write to Dan and Ken.

TODO: Mike will write to Ken.


## 3. Paperwork

> Is the old paperwork likely to turn up, or should we give up on that?

Peter has looked through bins of old records, but has not been able to access to ins going back further than 1998.

Among the documents yet to be located is the engineering report, which should contain lots of good information. Peter last remembers seeing it about 20 years ago, and thinks it very unlikely that the AMNH has a copy.

Peter does have a couple of documents, including a can of a very high level schematic of the exhibit produced by Applebaum (the design company) and another diagram showing the locations of the mounts' feet. (All of this was done before CAD was widespread, so there are no electronic records, only paper.)

TODO: Peter will send Mike scans of the two documents he has.

TODO: Peter will work with other RCI staff, during this period of relative downtime, to find the pre-1998 records, which have probably not been discarded, and will send whatever he can find.


## 4. Video

> How can we get the video into digital form?

I had misunderatood an earlier message as meaning that Peter had found an old VHS tape showing the trial mount. Nothing has yet been found, but the old recording probably still exists on a [Digital8](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital8) or similar small video cassette.

Among the many video recordings RCI made back in the day, some have been transferred to DVD, but Peter has not been able to find these either.

TODO: Peter will work with other RCI staff, during this period of relative downtime, to find the video cassette and/or DVD, and will send whatever he can find.


## 5. Schedule

Peter and his team will do their best find anything that's there to be found by Friday 13 December.

Based on whatever Peter is able to Recover, Mike will have the manuscript completed by the end of December.
