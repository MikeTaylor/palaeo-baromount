Hi Mike,

I didn't find much more than what I had. I've attached the blueprint drawings and the drawing I emailed to Melanie Ide at Appelbaum.

The specimen number for the carpals is DNM2568.

I'm not 100% sure but this small sauropod skeleton under the 'D' might be the one I took the molds from. I know it was on the right side of the exposure fairly high up.

Pretty sure that all of the infill in the skeleton was from the Carnegie Diplodocus, the distal end of the tail most of the chevrons, i think we also used the right scapula and tibia from Diplodocus, I've tried comparing the scaps and right scap of the Barosaurus doesn't look that far off the diplodocus scapula.

Back then everything would have been done over the telephone, I don't think Dinolab had a fax machine it was too new at the time.

I've had no luck on the video tapes either, we've gone through all the boxes we can find. They would be 8MM video tapes shot with a Sony Handycam. I might find them over the holidays, if they show up I'll send you an email right away.

Sorry I haven't got exactly what you are looking for.

All the best over the holidays.
