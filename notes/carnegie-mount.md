# Composition of the Carnegie _Diplodocus_ mount

What actually is in the Carnegie _Diplodocus_ mounted skeleton, and when did it get there?

The basic information is found in McIntosh's catalogue of the Carnegie Dinosaurs (McIntosh 1981:20):

> **_Diplodocus carnegii_** Hatcher, 1901  
> Cervicals 2-15, dorsals 1-10, sacrals 1-5, caudals 1-12, 18 ribs, left scapula (not right as stated by Hatcher), left coracoid, right ilium and a fragment of the left, pubes, ischia, right femur, both sternal plates, supposed clavicle.  
> [...]  
> This specimen forms the core of the skeleton which was mounted and put on display in 1907. The latter was completed by additions from several other individuals as follows: CM 94 (median caudals, right scapula-coracoid, right tibua-fibula-pes), CM 307 (distal caudals). The skull was modelled from the braincase of CM 662 and skull USNM 2673. The right forelimb (and also the left forelimb of the eleven casts of the skeleton sent to museums throughout the world) was accurately modelled from the larger manus AMNH 965 now known to belong to _Camarasaurus_, and too many phalanges were assigned to the manus. In the Carnegie Museum of Natural History only, the left forelimb CM 21775 now assigned to _Camarasaurus_ was used, as were the left fibula and partial pes CM 33985.

CM 662 was transferred to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History as CMNH 10670 and later to the Houston Museum of Natural History as HMNS 175, and is now recognized as the holotype of _Galeamopus hayi_.
