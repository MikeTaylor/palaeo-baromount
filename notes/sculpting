Subject: Re: [spam] Use of Carnegie Diplodocus material

Hi Mike,
I don't remember specifically what was sculpted, I'm sure we would have infilled as much as possible with Carnegie casts, there was a lot more sculpting in the baby Barosaurus than the adult.
We only used the Metacarpals from DNM. The phalanges and unguals probably came from the Diplodocus casts.
