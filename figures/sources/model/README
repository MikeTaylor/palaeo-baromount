Subject: Scale model of barosaur mount

Hi everyone,

Hope you're all doing well.

Mick and I have been working with the AMNH Main Archives to gain access to the scale model of the barosaur mount so we can photograph it for the paper. The folks from the Archives brought it over to the prep lab yesterday. A few quick photos that Mick took are attached. 

The distal portion of the allosaur neck with the skull will need to be reattached, and Mick will work with Verne in the VP prep lab to do that. Some ribs from the juvenile barosaur that had broken off have already been reattached. Once the remaining repair is completed, Mick will move the model into his office studio to photograph it for the paper.

Lowell
