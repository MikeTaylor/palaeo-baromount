Hi Mike,

Just a few thoughts to get the conversation started again...

1. Although you mention that the purpose of the mount was to introduce the theme of what we can and can't know about extinct dinosaurs, we would like to see that point emphasized more strongly. Perhaps there should be a short section near the start of the paper entitled: The Purpose of the Mount. There, we could essentially quote the exhibit label for the mount or the pertinent sections in the Next of Kin chapter or Mark's paper in Natural History. Also, once you draft the abstract, a short mention of the purpose could be included in there.

2. The images you've chosen so far are fine; however, since we went to the trouble to dig them up, it would be great to include a couple more. We'd suggest at least one from the initial assembly up at RCI near Toronto and at least one from the final assembly at AMNH. It would be nice to include one with Jack in it.

3. Finally, we are just curious; are you focusing on any particular journal for submission? We could look into a submission to Novitates at AMNH if you'd like.

There are some other more minor issues that we can address along the way as the ms develops.

Just so you know, I'll be away next week.

Lowell
