# Call with Peter May, 29 November 2024

Is it OK if I record?


## Metacarpals

> "metacarpals from Dinosaur National Monument were used in place of the camarasaurid metacarpals." Were the metacarpals casts or the original fossils? What was the specimen number?

Molded and cast one side, sculpted other side, original bones returned.

Peter will check on specimen number.

Jack ordered the casts from Dinolab

Peter went down to DNM and took molds from the face of the wall. Dan Chure was there. Peter can't remember what he took molds of, but might have been to juvenile. Call Ken.

Peter was only sculptor and does not remember doing anything.


## Mirroring

> "Some missing bones, including the left scapula and tibia, were sculpted based on their right-sided counterparts." Which others, and which just used from the Carnegie Diplodocus? Can we know?

## Paperwork

> Is the old paperwork likely to turn up, or should we give up on that?

Peter has looked through bins but can't get back further than 1998.

Saw engineering report about 20 years ago.

Has scan of Applebaum (designer) schematic, very high level.

Pre-CAD.

AMNH probably doesn't have the engineering report.


## Video

> How can we get the video into digital form?

It's on small VHS-like tapes that you use in a video camera. Peter has not yet found the tape.

Some have been transferred to DVD, but he hasn't found these either.


## Plan

Get everything in by mid December
