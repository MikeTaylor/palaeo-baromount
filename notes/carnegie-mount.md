# Composition of the Carnegie _Diplodocus_ mount

What actually is in the Carnegie _Diplodocus_ mounted skeleton, and when did it get there?

The basic information is found in McIntosh's catalogue of the Carnegie Dinosaurs (McIntosh 1981:20):

> **_Diplodocus carnegii_** Hatcher, 1901  
> Cervicals 2-15, dorsals 1-10, sacrals 1-5, caudals 1-12, 18 ribs, left scapula (not right as stated by Hatcher), left coracoid, right ilium and a fragment of the left, pubes, ischia, right femur, both sternal plates, supposed clavicle.  
> [...]  
> This specimen forms the core of the skeleton which was mounted and put on display in 1907. The latter was completed by additions from several other individuals as follows: CM 94 (median caudals, right scapula-coracoid, right tibia-fibula-pes), CM 307 (distal caudals). The skull was modelled from the braincase of CM 662 and skull USNM 2673. The right forelimb (and also the left forelimb of the eleven casts of the skeleton sent to museums throughout the world) was accurately modelled from the smaller individual CM 662. The forefeet were modelled from the larger manus AMNH 965 now known to belong to _Camarasaurus_, and too many phalanges were assigned to the manus. In the Carnegie Museum of Natural History only, the left forelimb CM 21775 now assigned to _Camarasaurus_ was used, as were the left fibula and partial pes CM 33985.

(CM 662 was transferred to the Cleveland Museum of Natural History as CMNH 10670 and later to the Houston Museum of Natural History as HMNS 175, and is now recognized as the holotype of _Galeamopus hayi_.)

This describes the mount as it was originally constructed in 1907, and the molds that were made from the elements that went into the mount.

This account omits the atlas (C1). Assuming that the "median caudals" from CM 94 begin at Ca19 and that those of CM 307 pick up where it left off, the axial skeleton is otherwise completely accounted for. The source of the left ilium, femur and tibia in the mount and casts is not given, nor is that of the fibula in the casts.

Modifications were made subsequently:
* At an unknown date, probably after 1981 since McIntosh's catalogue does not mention it, the skull was replaced with a cast of CM 11161.
* In the second quarter of 1999, the manus were replaced with casts of those of the former CM 662
* In late 2007, when the cast was remounted, the CM 662 manus casts were replaced with scaled-up replicas of a cast of the putative _Diplodocus carnegii_ manus described by Bedell and Trexler (2005)
* At this time, About ten sculpted posteriormost ("whiplash") caudals were added to bring the total number of caudal vertebrae to ~83
* The humeri, radii, and ulnae were replaced with replicas of cf. _Diplodocus_ specimens at Brigham Young University. They are scaled-up sculptures based on the smaller forelimb bones BYU 4742, BYU 4708, and BYU 4726.
