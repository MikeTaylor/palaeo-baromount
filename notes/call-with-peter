Things to discuss on the forthcoming call:

* Is the old paperwork likely to turn up?
* How can we get the VHS video into digital form?
* "Some missing bones, including the left scapula and tibia, were sculpted based on their right-sided counterparts." Which others? Can we know?
* "metacarpals from Dinosaur National Monument were used in place of the camarasaurid metacarpals." Were the metacarpals casts or the original fossils? What was the specimen number?
