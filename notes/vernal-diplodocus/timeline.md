# Timeline of the casts leading to the rearing _Barosaurus_

* 1901–1905 (more precision would be good): Carnegie Museum makes molds of _Diplodocus_
* 1905: Casts from these molds are erected as the mount at the BMNH
* 1905–: Nine more casts are sent to  Berlin, Paris, Vienna, Madrid, St Petersburg, Bologna, La Plata, Mexico City and Munich.
* 1907: The actual fossils (and some sculpted elements) are mounted at the Carnegie Museum.
* 1917 or earlier: the molds went into storage and were not used (Untermann 1959:364)
* 1948, autumn: The Utah Field House is built and opened.
* "Some time later", likely in the mid-1950s: J. LeRoy Kay, Carnegie's curator of vertebrate paleontology, gifted the original molds to the Field House
* 1957: The Utah Field House's concrete cast is mounted outdoors (Gangewere 1999:17)
* 1989, June 30 onwards: Jim Madsen of DINOLAB made new molds from the concrete _Diplodocus_, using them to create a new lightweight indoor _Diplodocus_ cast for the Field House and reserving the right to make up to 20 additional casts (Madsen et al. 1989)
* 1991, not later than June 20: DINOLAB was contracted to deliver the indoor mount (Madsen et al. 1989) — but I don't know when it actually arrived and was mounted.
* Some time subsequent to 1989: Peter May of RCI sources the new molds from DINOLAB and used them to cast _Diplodocus_ elements needed to make up the missing part of the AMNH Barosaurus mount.

Is all that correct?

According to Gangewere 1999:17, the creation of the concrete _Diplodocus_ was the last time the original Carnegie molds (described  "deteriorating") had been used, at least until that point, so the invitation offered by Untermann (1959:369), "Does anyone wish to cast the twelfth?" seems to have gone unanswered.

Does anyone know where the molds are now? Steve, you wrote "DINOLABS had all the molds. Apparently Carnegie didn't have the old molds, so I believe DINOLABS made new ones to create new replicas." So I think you're saying that DINOLABS had new molds taken from the concrete _Diplodocus_ (right?) — but then what happened to the original Carnegie molds? Does DINOLAB even exist any more?

Finally: I am struggling to make out the signatures on the Madsen et al. agreement. Can anyone help with the names?
