Hi Mike,

Here is a photo of Jack McIntosh and myself (red shirt) on the lift placing the Barosaurus humerus. On the ground left to right is Gene Gaffney, Mark Norrell and Lowell Dingus.

Nice! I'd seen this photo before but it's great to have the ID for the people.

Do you know who the third person on the gantry is?
